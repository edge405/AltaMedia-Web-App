# Admin Dashboard Integration with Client-Side Functionality

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Loading Process
```javascript
const loadClientData = () => {
  // Load companies from localStorage
  const savedCompanies = localStorage.getItem('userCompanies');
  
  // Load all related client data
  const clientData = {};
  const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
  
  keys.forEach(key => {
    if (key.startsWith('company_users_') || key.includes('brandkit')) {
      clientData[key] = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));
    }
  });
};
```

### Status Calculation
```javascript
const getCompanyStatus = (company) => {
  if (company.brandKitCompleted && getCompanyProgress(company) === 100) {
    return "completed";
  } else if (company.brandKitCompleted || getCompanyProgress(company) > 0) {
    return "active";
  } else {
    return "pending";
  }
};
```

### Progress Calculation
```javascript
const getCompanyProgress = (company) => {
  const products = company.products || [];
  const completedBrandKits = products.filter(p => p.brandKitCompleted).length;
  const companyBrandKit = company.brandKitCompleted ? 1 : 0;
  const totalItems = products.length + 1;
  const completedItems = completedBrandKits + companyBrandKit;
  
  return Math.round((completedItems / totalItems) * 100);
};
```
