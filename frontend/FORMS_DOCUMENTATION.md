});

const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
const [progress, setProgress] = useState(8.33); // 100% / 12 steps
```

### Navigation Logic
```javascript
const nextStep = () => {
  if (currentStep < 12) {
    setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);
    setProgress((currentStep + 1) * 8.33);
  }
};

const prevStep = () => {
  if (currentStep > 1) {

    setProgress((currentStep - 1) * 8.33);
  }
};
```

### Validation

    /* No overflow-y-auto */
  }
}

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .form-container {
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  .form-container {
    padding: 2rem;
